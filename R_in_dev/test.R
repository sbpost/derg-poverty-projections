# Instructions from Daniel ---
# Note that whenever the column inPovcalNet equals no, we do not have any
# primary data for the country and the numbers you see are simply the
# regional average. Kindly do not use these numbers unless you want to
# aggregate up to a regional or global number. If you only need our baseline
# estimate for each country, this code should do the work:
# 
# keep if inlist(alpha,0,.)
# keep if inlist(extragrowth,0,.)
# keep if inlist(gic,"l","")
# keep if inlist(passthrough,"mbrp","")
# keep if inlist(growth,"2008-2018","")
# keep country code year pop inPovcalNet FGT0_19
#  
# I think the rest is all self-explanatory but let me know if anything doesnâ€™t add up.
